CLASSES
	stats
	(a place to keep global vars + control vars)
		global vars:
			hp, chapter, level, xp
		global inventory:
			dictionary with [name, quantity]
		control dictionary:
			special keys unlocked (keep chapter here?)
		save method

	enemies
	(a place to create enemy variables, generate enemies and combats)
		enemy types:
			gnome, goblin, slime
		methods to add:
			enemy_gen:
				creates the enemies based on variable types
				generates specific eneimes for combat
				used to control "boss" vs "not boss"
			combat:
				method to run all the combat phase and interactions
				bridge between enemy_gen and player, basically

MAIN
	where the story happens
	each chapter as a method //? unsure if this is the best idea but tbh might be good to clean up main & keep it organized.
								use it as a static void? or maybe it'll return chapter number?
		c1: tutorial
		pulls from classes to keep main mostly "aesthetic" //run chapter methods and art design in main, brick them off at the top and collapse
