MAIN CLASS STRUCTURE

WHAT IT DO
	generates, organizes and stores player info
	could be possibly helpful if there is intent to do a local multiplayer thing (i used to know how to do this if there's any interest in trying it out -v)

global variables:
	hp, baseAttack, chapter, level, xp = 10, 3, 1, 1, 0

global inventory:
	dictionary with [name, quantity]

control dictionary:
	special keys unlocked (keep chapter here? + level)

save method
	gamestate save

properties & types
	int
		hp
		base
		chapter
		level
		xp
	str
		player_name
	dict
		inventory //public
		keys //for controlling possible storylines (useless if only c1?)

behaviors & desc
	xp_gain() - xp = xp + enemy_xp; checks if max for level reached, triggers levelup()
	levelup() - level +=1, hp +=X, base +=X

if gamestate save will exist then sql integration might be a good idea? (i only know how to do gamestate saves for databases, sorry -v)
