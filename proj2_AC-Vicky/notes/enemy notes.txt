enemy_gen: METHOD //static, receives number of enemies+type of enemy when applicable with pseudo s/c, returns enemy_stats
																												enemy stats:
																												level (work hp, base damage in function of)
																												boss factor
																												xp yield
	creates the enemies based on variable types
	generates specific enemies for combat
	used to control "boss" vs "not boss"
	
combat: METHOD //static, receives enemy_stats, returns combat damage
	method to run all the combat phase and interactions
	bridge between enemy_gen and player, basically
		a, d, m = "attack", "defense", "magic"
		a = give+1, take+1
		d = give-1, take-1
		m = give, take

		if (pChoice == eChoice):
			TIE
			a vs a (base+1) vs (base+1)
			d vs d (base-1) vs (base-1)
			m vs m (base) vs (base)

		a > m; (base+1) vs (base) = (base+1) (0); (== m < a)
		d > a; (base+1) vs (base-1) = (0) (base); (== a < d)
		m > d; (base) vs (base-1) = (base) (0); (== d < m)
