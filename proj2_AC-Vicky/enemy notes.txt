		a, d, m = "attack", "defense", "magic"
		a = give+1, take+1
		d = give-1, take-1
		m = give, take

		if (pChoice == eChoice):
			TIE
			a vs a (base+1) vs (base+1)
			d vs d (base-1) vs (base-1)
			m vs m (base) vs (base)

		a > m; (base+1) vs (base) = (base+1) (0); (== m < a)
		d > a; (base+1) vs (base-1) = (0) (base); (== a < d)
		m > d; (base) vs (base-1) = (base) (0); (== d < m)
